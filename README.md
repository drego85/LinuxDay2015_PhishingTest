# LinuxDay2015 Phishing Demonstration
Phishing Demonstration during Linux Day 2015

During the Linux Day 2015 in Orvieto (Italy) I have demonstrated what is phishing.

I distributed on all 100 seats of the classroom a piece of paper that says "Access FreeWifi, get the password by logging into your Gmail account" and a code QRCode.

The QRCode linked the user to the code posted here, you displayed the page Phishing against Google.

The script shows the same layout of Google Gmail and collect the eMail user, being a demonstration you can not type your password integral (only the first character).

People.txt file you can view the eMail type, the useragente, including date and time.
